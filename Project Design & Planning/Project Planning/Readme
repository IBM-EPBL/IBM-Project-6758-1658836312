Once the model is made to run , now it is ready for domestic use.
We can now access the webpage anytime after connecting the ibm watson cloud platform to the model.

The idea of this application is that the user can capture the images of different 
fruits and vegetables, and then the image will be sent to the trained model. 
The model analyses the image and detects the nutrition based on the fruits like 
(Sugar, Fibre, Protein, Calorie intake, etc.). The above idea is achieved by using 
the Convolution Neural Network (CNN) . It is used to pick the raw pixels 
present in the image . Fruit Recognition using Colour and Texture Features .
