We use HTML to create the front-end part of the web page. 

Here, we have created 3 HTML pages- home.html, image.html,imageprediction.html, and 0.html.

home.html displays the home page.

image.html is used for uploading the image

imageprediction.html will showcase the output

0.html is to showcase the result. It tells the action to be performed on imageprediction.html while showcasing the result.
