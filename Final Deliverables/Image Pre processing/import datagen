Image data augmentation is a technique that can be used to artificially expand the size of a training dataset by creating modified versions of images in the dataset.


The Keras deep learning neural network library provides the capability to fit models using image data augmentation via the ImageDataGenerator class.

we can import the ImageDataGenerator class from Keras
