In order to develop this project we need to install the following software/packages:
Anaconda Navigator 
Anaconda Navigator is a free and open-source distribution of the Python and R programming languages for data science and machine learning-related applications. It can be installed on Windows, Linux, and macOS. Conda is an open-source, cross-platform,  package management system. Anaconda comes with great tools like JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook, QtConsole, Spyder, Glueviz, Orange, Rstudio, Visual Studio Code. 

For this project, we will be using a Jupyter notebook and Spyder

To install the Anaconda navigator and to know how to use Jupyter Notebook & Spyder using Anaconda watch the video
